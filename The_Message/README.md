# The Message
It happened. [We managed to extract the message](https://twitter.com/danieladepaulis/status/1664251594064494595). The message can be downloaded [in raw binary form (MSB first)](../Candidates/artifacts/data17.bin) and [plain text bits (ones and zeroes)](../Candidates/artifacts/data17.txt).

A preliminary analysis, including a potential representation as a picture, [can be found here](analysis/preliminary.md).

The big question therefore remains: **what does it mean?**

This folder attempts to be a compendium of all the theories on the meaning of the message proposed  by the public in the Discord's channel `#interpretation-chat`.


## Current interpretations
Since the picture representation of the data was the one that raised more interest and may bias the interpretation in the wrong direction, the following list is divided in picture-based and non-picture-based interpretations. **If your interpretation is missing, do not hesitate and send us a pull request with the changes or contact us directly in the Discord channel (HaileyStorm or BatchDrake)**.

### Picture based interpretations
* **[monarchofdhadow's interpretation](analysis/monarchofshadow.md)**
* **[BatchDrake's analysis on the pattern properties](analysis/batchdrake.md)**
### Non-picture based interpretations
* TBD
